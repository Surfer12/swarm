## Agents Review Summary

I'll review the agents in the airline example to understand their structure and implementation.

<understanding>
The airline example demonstrates a sophisticated multi-agent system built on the Swarm framework. It implements a hierarchical customer service architecture with clear separation of concerns and evaluation mechanisms.
</understanding>

<analysis>
**Agent Architecture:**
1. **Triage Agent** - Entry point that routes requests to appropriate specialized agents
2. **Flight Modification Agent** - Secondary triage for flight-related requests
3. **Flight Cancel Agent** - Handles cancellations with refund/credit options
4. **Flight Change Agent** - Manages flight changes and rescheduling
5. **Lost Baggage Agent** - Processes baggage-related inquiries

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **Hierarchical Routing**: Multi-level triage (Triage → Flight Modification → Specific Action)
- **Policy-Driven Behavior**: Each agent follows strict policy documents
- **Function-Based Actions**: Clear function calls for specific operations
- **Context Awareness**: Uses customer and flight context variables
- **Evaluation Framework**: Systematic testing with accuracy metrics

**Security & Safety Features:**
- Strict policy adherence with no deviation
- Context isolation (customer details separated)
- Escalation paths for edge cases
- No policy sharing with users
</analysis>

<exploration>
**Evaluation System:**
- Function-based testing with expected vs actual outcomes
- Multiple iterations per test case for reliability
- JSON-based test case storage for maintainability
- Accuracy tracking with percentage metrics

**Agent Communication:**
- Transfer functions for agent handoffs
- Context variables for shared state
- Tool calls for specific actions
- Case resolution tracking
</exploration>

<solution>
The system demonstrates excellent separation of concerns with:
- Clear agent specialization
- Systematic evaluation framework
- Policy-driven behavior
- Context-aware operations
- Robust testing mechanisms
</solution>

<reflection>
This architecture effectively handles the complexity of airline customer service while maintaining auditability and testability. The hierarchical triage system prevents agents from handling requests outside their domain, while the evaluation framework ensures consistent behavior across scenarios.

I'll conduct a comprehensive review of the Swarm framework architecture and implementation.## Swarm Framework Review

<understanding>
The Swarm framework is a lightweight, agent-based orchestration system built on top of OpenAI's API. It provides a structured approach to building multi-agent systems with clear separation of concerns, robust error handling, and comprehensive evaluation capabilities.
</understanding>

<analysis>
**Core Architecture Components:**

1. **Swarm Class** (`core.py` lines 26-291)
   - Central orchestration engine
   - Handles agent lifecycle, tool execution, and context management
   - Supports both streaming and non-streaming modes
   - Deep copy isolation for context variables and message history

2. **Agent Model** (`types.py` lines 14-21)
   - Pydantic-based immutable configuration
   - Flexible instructions (string or callable)
   - Tool execution control (tool_choice, parallel_tool_calls)
   - Model override capability

3. **Function Introspection** (`util.py` lines 31-87)
   - Automatic JSON schema generation from Python functions
   - Type mapping for OpenAI compatibility
   - Runtime signature inspection and validation

**Key Design Patterns:**

- **Functional Handoff**: Agents can return other agents for seamless transitions
- **Context Isolation**: Deep copying prevents cross-contamination
- **Tool Abstraction**: Automatic parameter hiding (__CTX_VARS_NAME__)
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response processing with merge_chunk utility

**Security & Safety Features:**

- Input validation through signature inspection
- Context variable isolation
- Error handling with debug logging
- Type-safe function parameter mapping
</analysis>

<exploration>
**Advanced Features:**

- **Dynamic Instructions**: Callable instructions allow runtime context adaptation
- **Parallel Tool Execution**: Configurable parallel tool calls
- **Streaming Response Processing**: Real-time chunk merging for smooth UX
- **Context Variable Management**: Automatic injection and cleanup

**Evaluation Framework Integration:**
- Function-based testing with expected outcomes
- JSON-serializable test cases
- Accuracy metrics and reporting
- Systematic evaluation across scenarios
</exploration>

<solution>
The Swarm framework demonstrates excellent architectural decisions:

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only OpenAI and Pydantic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and validation
- **Extensibility**: Clean interfaces for custom implementations
- **Testing Support**: Built-in evaluation and debugging utilities
- **Production Ready**: Error handling, logging, and context isolation
</solution>

<reflection>
This framework successfully balances simplicity with power. The functional handoff pattern is particularly elegant - agents returning other agents creates a natural flow for complex multi-agent systems. The deep copying approach ensures thread safety and prevents state leakage between agents.
</reflection>

<endpoint>
**Key Strengths:**
- Clean separation between orchestration and business logic
- Robust error handling throughout the pipeline
- Comprehensive type safety without being overly restrictive
- Excellent testing and evaluation support
- Production-ready with proper isolation and security measures
</endpoint>
